            <p><strong>José Mário dos Santos Mourinho Félix</strong> is a Portuguese professional football manager and
                former player who is the current head coach of Italian Serie A club Roma. He is widely considered to be
                one of the greatest managers of all time, and is one of the most decorated managers ever.</p>
            <p>After an uneventful career as a midfielder in the Portuguese leagues, Mourinho moved into coaching, first
                as an interpreter for Sir Bobby Robson at Sporting CP and Porto, before gaining success as an assistant
                at Barcelona under both Robson and his successor, Louis van Gaal. After impressing with brief stints at
                Benfica and União de Leiria, Mourinho returned to Porto as manager in 2002, winning the Primeira Liga
                twice, a Taça de Portugal, the UEFA Cup, and the UEFA Champions League, Porto's first European Cup title
                since 1987. That success earned him a move to England with Chelsea in 2004, where he won two Premier
                League titles, an FA Cup, and two League Cups in his three seasons at the club, before he departed in
                2007 amid reports of disagreements with club owner Roman Abramovich.</p>
            <p>In 2008, Mourinho joined Italian club Inter Milan, where he won Serie A twice, including a European
                treble of Serie A, the Coppa Italia, and the UEFA Champions League in 2010, a first for an Italian club.
                This made him one of five coaches to have won the European Cup with two clubs, and later that year,
                earned him the first FIFA World Coach of the Year. Mourinho then moved to Real Madrid, where he won La
                Liga in 2011–12 with a record points tally, becoming the fifth coach to have won league titles in four
                countries. He also won a Copa del Rey and a Supercopa de España.</p>
            <p>Mourinho left Real Madrid in 2013 and rejoined Chelsea, where he won another league title and League Cup,
                but was dismissed in 2015 after a poor run of results. In 2016, Mourinho was appointed at Manchester
                United, and won the UEFA Europa League, League Cup, and FA Community Shield in his first season. In
                2018, after Manchester United suffered a poor run of league results, he was dismissed. In 2019, he
                became manager of Tottenham Hotspur, reaching the final of the League Cup in his second season but was
                dismissed in April 2021. He was soon hired by Roma.</p>
            <p>He was named Portuguese Coach of the Century by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) in 2015, and was
                the first coach to spend more than £1 billion on transfers. Due to his tactical knowledge, charismatic
                and controversial personality, and a reputation for prioritising results over attractive football, he
                has drawn comparisons, by both admirers and critics, with Argentine manager Helenio Herrera.</p>
